# Blackjack-v2

Updated Blackjack game

Started making a new blackjack game from scratch, utilizing an array of objects containing information about the different cards that would randomly be picked.

STATUS and KNOWN ISSUES:

- The dealer will draw a third card if the combined value of his first two is below 17, however, if the new combined value of his now three cards is still below 17, he will not draw another card.
- All aces has a value of 11 and not 2

NEXT UP:

- Adding stakes and a summary of chips acquired/lost that updates throghout the session.
